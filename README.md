# osig-cli

A Python cli to generate open-graph images for web pages. Heavily based on the work of [osig.app](https://osig.app).

## License

The original work from [osig.app](https://osig.app) is licensed under Apache 2.0, so I have to include a change list:

- Extracted only the code that generates the images from [osig.app](https://osig.app).
- Added cli argument parsing.
- Refactored the image generation code into classes.
